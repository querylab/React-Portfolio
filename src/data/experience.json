        "HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, in addition to 3 infrared sensors,a led and a buzzer the main idea is to create a robot that can follow a black line on a track, marked with a white background and that can move along the black line, in addition to this you can also detect flat objects located vertically in your path,which are at a distance of 10-12cm,once you detect the object stops and when you remove it continue."
